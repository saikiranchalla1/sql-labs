The SQL SELECT statement is used to fetch the data from a database table which returns this data in the form of a result table. These result tables are called result-sets.

Syntax
The basic syntax of the SELECT statement is as follows −

    SELECT column1, column2, columnN FROM table_name;
Here, column1, column2... are the fields of a table whose values you want to fetch. If you want to fetch all the fields available in the field, then you can use the following syntax.

    SELECT * FROM table_name;
Example
Consider the CUSTOMERS table having the following records −

    +----+----------+-----+-----------+----------+
    | ID | NAME     | AGE | ADDRESS   | SALARY   |
    +----+----------+-----+-----------+----------+
    |  1 | Ramesh   |  32 | Ahmedabad |  2000.00 |
    |  2 | Khilan   |  25 | Delhi     |  1500.00 |
    |  3 | kaushik  |  23 | Kota      |  2000.00 |
    |  4 | Chaitali |  25 | Mumbai    |  6500.00 |
    |  5 | Hardik   |  27 | Bhopal    |  8500.00 |
    |  6 | Komal    |  22 | MP        |  4500.00 |
    |  7 | Muffy    |  24 | Indore    | 10000.00 |
+----+----------+-----+-----------+----------+
The following code is an example, which would fetch the ID, Name and Salary fields of the customers available in CUSTOMERS table.

    SQL> SELECT ID, NAME, SALARY FROM CUSTOMERS;
This would produce the following result −

    +----+----------+----------+
    | ID | NAME     | SALARY   |
    +----+----------+----------+
    |  1 | Ramesh   |  2000.00 |
    |  2 | Khilan   |  1500.00 |
    |  3 | kaushik  |  2000.00 |
    |  4 | Chaitali |  6500.00 |
    |  5 | Hardik   |  8500.00 |
    |  6 | Komal    |  4500.00 |
    |  7 | Muffy    | 10000.00 |
    +----+----------+----------+
If you want to fetch all the fields of the CUSTOMERS table, then you should use the following query.

    SQL> SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS;
This would produce the result as shown below.

    +----+----------+-----+-----------+----------+
    | ID | NAME     | AGE | ADDRESS   | SALARY   |
    +----+----------+-----+-----------+----------+
    |  1 | Ramesh   |  32 | Ahmedabad |  2000.00 |
    |  2 | Khilan   |  25 | Delhi     |  1500.00 |
    |  3 | kaushik  |  23 | Kota      |  2000.00 |
    |  4 | Chaitali |  25 | Mumbai    |  6500.00 |
    |  5 | Hardik   |  27 | Bhopal    |  8500.00 |
    |  6 | Komal    |  22 | MP        |  4500.00 |
    |  7 | Muffy    |  24 | Indore    | 10000.00 |
    +----+----------+-----+-----------+----------+
