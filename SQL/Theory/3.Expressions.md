An expression is a combination of one or more values, operators and SQL functions that evaluate to a value. These SQL EXPRESSIONs are like formulae and they are written in query language. You can also use them to query the database for a specific set of data.

####Syntax
Consider the basic syntax of the SELECT statement as follows −

    SELECT column1, column2, columnN 
    FROM table_name 
    WHERE [CONDITION|EXPRESSION];
There are different types of SQL expressions, which are mentioned below −

    Boolean
    Numeric
    Date
Let us now discuss each of these in detail.

####Boolean Expressions
SQL Boolean Expressions fetch the data based on matching a single value. Following is the syntax −

    SELECT column1, column2, columnN 
    FROM table_name 
    WHERE SINGLE VALUE MATCHING EXPRESSION;
Consider the CUSTOMERS table having the following records −

    SQL> SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS;
    +----+----------+-----+-----------+----------+
    | ID | NAME     | AGE | ADDRESS   | SALARY   |
    +----+----------+-----+-----------+----------+
    |  1 | Ramesh   |  32 | Ahmedabad |  2000.00 |
    |  2 | Khilan   |  25 | Delhi     |  1500.00 |
    |  3 | kaushik  |  23 | Kota      |  2000.00 |
    |  4 | Chaitali |  25 | Mumbai    |  6500.00 |
    |  5 | Hardik   |  27 | Bhopal    |  8500.00 |
    |  6 | Komal    |  22 | MP        |  4500.00 |
    |  7 | Muffy    |  24 | Indore    | 10000.00 |
    +----+----------+-----+-----------+----------+
    7 rows in set (0.00 sec)
The following table is a simple example showing the usage of various SQL Boolean Expressions −

    SQL> SELECT * FROM CUSTOMERS WHERE SALARY = 10000;
    +----+-------+-----+---------+----------+
    | ID | NAME  | AGE | ADDRESS | SALARY   |
    +----+-------+-----+---------+----------+
    |  7 | Muffy |  24 | Indore  | 10000.00 |
    +----+-------+-----+---------+----------+
    1 row in set (0.00 sec)
####Numeric Expression
These expressions are used to perform any mathematical operation in any query. Following is the syntax −

    SELECT numerical_expression as  OPERATION_NAME
    [FROM table_name
    WHERE CONDITION] ;
Here, the numerical_expression is used for a mathematical expression or any formula. Following is a simple example showing the usage of SQL Numeric Expressions −

    SQL> SELECT (15 + 6) AS ADDITION
    +----------+
    | ADDITION |
    +----------+
    |       21 |
    +----------+
    1 row in set (0.00 sec)
There are several built-in functions like avg(), sum(), count(), etc., to perform what is known as the aggregate data calculations against a table or a specific table column.

    SQL> SELECT COUNT(*) AS "RECORDS" FROM CUSTOMERS; 
    +---------+
    | RECORDS |
    +---------+
    |       7 |
    +---------+
    1 row in set (0.00 sec)
####Date Expressions
Date Expressions return current system date and time values −

    SQL>  SELECT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP;
    +---------------------+
    | Current_Timestamp   |
    +---------------------+
    | 2009-11-12 06:40:23 |
    +---------------------+
    1 row in set (0.00 sec)
Another date expression is as shown below −

    SQL>  SELECT  GETDATE();;
    +-------------------------+
    | GETDATE                 |
    +-------------------------+
    | 2009-10-22 12:07:18.140 |
    +-------------------------+
    1 row in set (0.00 sec)
