The SQL DROP TABLE statement is used to remove a table definition and all the data, indexes, triggers, constraints and permission specifications for that table.

NOTE − You should be very careful while using this command because once a table is deleted then all the information available in that table will also be lost forever.

Syntax
The basic syntax of this DROP TABLE statement is as follows −

    DROP TABLE table_name;
Example
Let us first verify the CUSTOMERS table and then we will delete it from the database as shown below −

    SQL> DESC CUSTOMERS;
    +---------+---------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
    | Field   | Type          | Null | Key | Default | Extra |
    +---------+---------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
    | ID      | int(11)       | NO   | PRI |         |       |
    | NAME    | varchar(20)   | NO   |     |         |       |
    | AGE     | int(11)       | NO   |     |         |       |
    | ADDRESS | char(25)      | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
    | SALARY  | decimal(18,2) | YES  |     | NULL    |       |
    +---------+---------------+------+-----+---------+-------+
    5 rows in set (0.00 sec)
This means that the CUSTOMERS table is available in the database, so let us now drop it as shown below.

    SQL> DROP TABLE CUSTOMERS;
    Query OK, 0 rows affected (0.01 sec)
Now, if you would try the DESC command, then you will get the following error −

    SQL> DESC CUSTOMERS;
    ERROR 1146 (42S02): Table 'TEST.CUSTOMERS' doesn't exist
Here, TEST is the database name which we are using for our examples.
