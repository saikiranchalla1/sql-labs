The SQL DISTINCT keyword is used in conjunction with the SELECT statement to eliminate all the duplicate records and fetching only unique records.

There may be a situation when you have multiple duplicate records in a table. While fetching such records, it makes more sense to fetch only those unique records instead of fetching duplicate records.

Syntax
The basic syntax of DISTINCT keyword to eliminate the duplicate records is as follows −

    SELECT DISTINCT column1, column2,.....columnN 
    FROM table_name
    WHERE [condition]
Example
Consider the CUSTOMERS table having the following records −

    +----+----------+-----+-----------+----------+
    | ID | NAME     | AGE | ADDRESS   | SALARY   |
    +----+----------+-----+-----------+----------+
    |  1 | Ramesh   |  32 | Ahmedabad |  2000.00 |
    |  2 | Khilan   |  25 | Delhi     |  1500.00 |
    |  3 | kaushik  |  23 | Kota      |  2000.00 |
    |  4 | Chaitali |  25 | Mumbai    |  6500.00 |
    |  5 | Hardik   |  27 | Bhopal    |  8500.00 |
    |  6 | Komal    |  22 | MP        |  4500.00 |
    |  7 | Muffy    |  24 | Indore    | 10000.00 |
    +----+----------+-----+-----------+----------+
First, let us see how the following SELECT query returns the duplicate salary records.

    SQL> SELECT SALARY FROM CUSTOMERS
    ORDER BY SALARY;
This would produce the following result, where the salary (2000) is coming twice which is a duplicate record from the original table.

    +----------+
    | SALARY   |
    +----------+
    |  1500.00 |
    |  2000.00 |
    |  2000.00 |
    |  4500.00 |
    |  6500.00 |
    |  8500.00 |
    | 10000.00 |
    +----------+
Now, let us use the DISTINCT keyword with the above SELECT query and then see the result.

    SQL> SELECT DISTINCT SALARY FROM CUSTOMERS
    ORDER BY SALARY;
This would produce the following result where we do not have any duplicate entry.

    +----------+
    | SALARY   |
    +----------+
    |  1500.00 |
    |  2000.00 |
    |  4500.00 |
    |  6500.00 |
    |  8500.00 |
    | 10000.00 |
    +----------+
