The SQL DROP DATABASE statement is used to drop an existing database in SQL schema.

Syntax
The basic syntax of DROP DATABASE statement is as follows −

    DROP DATABASE DatabaseName;
Always the database name should be unique within the RDBMS.

Example
If you want to delete an existing database <testDB>, then the DROP DATABASE statement would be as shown below −

    SQL> DROP DATABASE testDB;
NOTE − Be careful before using this operation because by deleting an existing database would result in loss of complete information stored in the database.

Make sure you have the admin privilege before dropping any database. Once a database is dropped, you can check it in the list of the databases as shown below −

    SQL> SHOW DATABASES;
    +--------------------+
    | Database           |
    +--------------------+
    | information_schema |
    | AMROOD             |

    | mysql              |
    | orig               |
    | test               |
    +--------------------+
