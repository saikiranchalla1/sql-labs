The SQL DELETE Query is used to delete the existing records from a table.

You can use the WHERE clause with a DELETE query to delete the selected rows, otherwise all the records would be deleted.

Syntax
The basic syntax of the DELETE query with the WHERE clause is as follows −

    DELETE FROM table_name
    WHERE [condition];
You can combine N number of conditions using AND or OR operators.

Example
Consider the CUSTOMERS table having the following records −

    +----+----------+-----+-----------+----------+
    | ID | NAME     | AGE | ADDRESS   | SALARY   |
    +----+----------+-----+-----------+----------+
    |  1 | Ramesh   |  32 | Ahmedabad |  2000.00 |
    |  2 | Khilan   |  25 | Delhi     |  1500.00 |
    |  3 | kaushik  |  23 | Kota      |  2000.00 |
    |  4 | Chaitali |  25 | Mumbai    |  6500.00 |
    |  5 | Hardik   |  27 | Bhopal    |  8500.00 |
    |  6 | Komal    |  22 | MP        |  4500.00 |
    |  7 | Muffy    |  24 | Indore    | 10000.00 |
    +----+----------+-----+-----------+----------+
The following code has a query, which will DELETE a customer, whose ID is 6.

    SQL> DELETE FROM CUSTOMERS
    WHERE ID = 6;
Now, the CUSTOMERS table would have the following records.

    +----+----------+-----+-----------+----------+
    | ID | NAME     | AGE | ADDRESS   | SALARY   |
    +----+----------+-----+-----------+----------+
    |  1 | Ramesh   |  32 | Ahmedabad |  2000.00 |
    |  2 | Khilan   |  25 | Delhi     |  1500.00 |
    |  3 | kaushik  |  23 | Kota      |  2000.00 |
    |  4 | Chaitali |  25 | Mumbai    |  6500.00 |
    |  5 | Hardik   |  27 | Bhopal    |  8500.00 |
    |  7 | Muffy    |  24 | Indore    | 10000.00 |
    +----+----------+-----+-----------+----------+
If you want to DELETE all the records from the CUSTOMERS table, you do not need to use the WHERE clause and the DELETE query would be as follows −

    SQL> DELETE FROM CUSTOMERS;
Now, the CUSTOMERS table would not have any record.
