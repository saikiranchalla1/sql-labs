When you have multiple databases in your SQL Schema, then before starting your operation, you would need to select a database where all the operations would be performed.

The SQL USE statement is used to select any existing database in the SQL schema.

Syntax
The basic syntax of the USE statement is as shown below −

    USE DatabaseName;
Always the database name should be unique within the RDBMS.

Example
You can check the available databases as shown below −

    SQL> SHOW DATABASES;
    +--------------------+
    | Database           |
    +--------------------+
    | information_schema |
    | AMROOD             |
    | TUTORIALSPOINT     |
    | mysql              |
    | orig               |
    | test               |
    +--------------------+
    6 rows in set (0.00 sec)
Now, if you want to work with the AMROOD database, then you can execute the following SQL command and start working with the AMROOD database.

    SQL> USE AMROOD;
